            <h2>Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies 
                series.</h2>
            <p>In each episode, the cunning, insidious and constantly hungry
                Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner,
                a fast-running ground bird,
                but is never successful.</p> 
            <p>The characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-television cartoons. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons like Tom and Jerry, but became popular in its own right.</p>
            <h2>Scenery</h2>
            <p>The desert scenery in the following Road Runner cartoons were designed by Robert Gribbroek and was quite realistic.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fast and Furry-ous (1949)</li>
                    <li>Beep, Beep (1952),</li>
                    <li>Going! Going! Gosh! (also 1952)</li>
